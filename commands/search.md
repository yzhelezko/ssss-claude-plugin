# Semantic Code Search

Use the SSSS MCP server to perform a semantic search for: "$ARGUMENTS"

Search the indexed codebase and return relevant results. For each result, show:
1. The file path and line numbers
2. The code snippet
3. Usage information (if available):
   - Whether it's exported/private
   - Functions it calls
   - Functions that call it
   - Whether it has test coverage

Present results in a clear, organized format with the most relevant matches first.
